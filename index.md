## Failt√©
Hello and welcome to **Step Into Swift**. I am an iOS and Swift Developer and this is my attempt at giving back to the community for all that I have learned over the years.

As I learn new things, remember something I wish was explained to me when I was starting out or, come across a particular problem I have solved in my current role as an iOS Engineer, I will add it to this site to hopefully help others who may have been in my shoes at some stage of their career. I will attempt to keep posts short and to the point. More of a reference than a full in depth article.

I believe in helping others without seeking self promotion or gain, so the content will always be free. I hope that you enjoy and find this site useful.

_Step Into Swift is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}._
