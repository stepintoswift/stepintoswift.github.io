## iOS & Swift Tutorials

Failt√© go **Step Into Swift**. I am an iOS and Swift Developer and this is **Step Into Swift**!

I created **Step Into Swift** to help others learn Swift and iOS. I have over 15 years experience in the industry using various technologies now specialising in Swift and iOS. As I learn new things, remember something I wish was explained to me when I was starting out, or come across a particular problem I have solved, I will update this site to help others who may have been in my shoes at some stage of their career. I will try to cut the waffle and get straight to the point.

The technology industry has turned into a place where it is now all about your "personal brand", showing off and playing the game of office politics. I try to stay true to myself by helping others without self promotion or gain. I hope there are a few out there like me who just want to learn cool things and help others because it's the right thing to do! Hopefully together we can stop this trend that has infected the technology industry.
