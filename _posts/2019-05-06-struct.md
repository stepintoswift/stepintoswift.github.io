## Struct

- Should use by default where possible.
- Subject should be small with not much going on.
- Use a `Class` if things get more complicated.
- It's a `value` type. (Post TBC - Value type vs Reference type)
- Stored on the `stack`.
- If it is a class member, it is stored on the heap.
- Copied (Passed by value).
- Protocol conformance.
- Comes with a memberwise initializer (Post TBC - Memberwise initializers).
- Extension keeps memberwise initializer (Post TBC - Extending a struct).
- Examples: `String`, `Array`, `Dict`, `Int`.
- Thread safe.
- Used a lot in protocol orientated programming.
- No dynamic memory allocation.
- Reference counting does not apply (Post TBC - ARC).
- Protocols allow classes, structs and enums to participate in a form of inheritance (Post TBC - Protocols).

Example:

```swift
struct Size {
  let width: Int
  let height: Int
}
```
