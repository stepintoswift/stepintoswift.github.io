## Rx: Just Operator

- `.just` operator creates an observable sequence containing `just` a single element and a `.completed` event.
- Type inference means we donâ€™t need to define the type.

```
let lotteryNumberOne = 1
let lotteryNumberTwo = 2
let lotteryNumberThree = 3

let observable: Observable<Int> = Observable<Int>.just(lotteryNumberOne)
// Observable containing just lotteryNumberOne i.e. 1
```
