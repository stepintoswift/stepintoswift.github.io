## Variable

A `variable` is a value that **can** be changed.

To declare a variable simply put `var` in front of the variable name:

```
var player: String = "Henrik Larsson"
```

Change `player` by setting its value to another of the correct type:

```
player = "Chris Sutton"
```

If you declare an object as a variable and do not change it, Xcode will warn prompt you to change the variable to a [constant]({% post_url 2019-05-06-constant %}).
