## Introduction to RX and Observables

EVERYTHING IS A SEQUENCE
OR
SOMETHING THAT WORKS WITH A SEQUENCE

— An observable is just a sequence with special abilities. For example, it is asynchronous.
— Observables produce events. We say that they are “emitting”.
— Events can contain
	— Values (Numbers, instances of a custom type)
	— Gesture recognisers (`Tap`)
— Observables emit `next` events until `error` event or `competion` event.
— When an `error` or `completion` event occurs, this results in termination and no more events get emitted.
— RX methods are referred to as operators.
— Observable is a sequence definition that must be subscribed to for anything to really happen.
— Observables must be defined as being a specific type if the type cannot be inferred.
