## Constant

A `constant` is a value that **cannot** be changed.

To declare a constant simply put the word `let` name of the constant:

```
let player: String = "Henrik Larsson"
```

If we wanted to change `player`:

```
player = "Chris Sutton"
```

We would not be able to do so as constants cannot be changed. You would be presented with the error: `Cannot assign to value: 'player' is a 'let' constant`.

Use constant by default and change to a [variable]({% post_url 2019-05-06-variable %}) if you want to change it. Xcode is pretty decent at warning you about this.
