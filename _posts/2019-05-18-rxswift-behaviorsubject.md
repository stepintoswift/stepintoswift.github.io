## RxSwift: BehaviorSubject

- Similar to a `PublishSubject` except, it will replay the latest `.next` event to new subscribers.
- Needs a initial value upon creation - If you canâ€™t think of one use a PublishSubject
- Starts with an initial value and replays it or the latest element to new subscribers.
- Useful when you want to repopulate a view with the most recent data.

```swift
let subject = BehaviorSubject<String>(value: "8 in a row!")
```
