## RXSwift: `of` operator

— `.of` takes a variadic parameter
— Creates an `observable` of the specified type (Not an array of that type unless you provide the parameter as an array)
— Type inference kicks in here so the type is not needed.


```
let lotteryNumberOne = 1
let lotteryNumberTwo = 2
let lotteryNumberThree = 3

let observable = Observable.of(lotteryNumberOne, lotteryNumberTwo, lotteryNumberThree)
// Observable of INT

let observable = Observable.of([lotteryNumberOne, lotteryNumberTwo, lotteryNumberThree])
// Observable array of Int
```
