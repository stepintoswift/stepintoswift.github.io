# Class
- Reference type.
- Stored on the heap.
- Can be inherited.
- It is a blueprint.
- An object is an instance of a class.
- Type casting done at runtime.
- Includes a `deinit` - Clean up resources in class lifecycle.
- Can be more than one reference to a class.
- No memberwise initializer.
- Use when we need Objective-C interoperability.
- Use when you need to control identity of data.
- Class inheritance only with other classes.

Example:

```
class UserAccountViewController: UIViewController {
  ...
}
```
