## RxSwift: Hot vs Cold Observable

### Hot Observable
- A "hot" Observable begins emitting elements immediately and before it is subscribed to.
- Any observer who later subscribes to a "hot" Observable may start observing the sequence anywhere in the middle.

### Cold Observable
- A "cold" Observable begins emitting elements only when it is subscribed to.
- A subscriber of a "cold" Observable is guaranteed to see the whole sequence from the beginning.
