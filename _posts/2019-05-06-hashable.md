## Hashable

- Used internally by sets and dictionaries to make lookups consistently fast.
- Can reduce its value to single `Int`.
- Allows use of object as keys in dictionary.
- Allows custom types to be comparable via hashable.
- Types such as Strings, integers, floats and boolean values already conform to hashable.

```swift
  extension GridPoint: Hashable {
    ...
  }
```
