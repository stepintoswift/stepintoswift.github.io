## Rx: Subscribing to Observables

- Observables will NOT send events until they have a subscriber.
- It is the subscription that triggers an observable to begin emitting events until `.error` or `.completed` is emitted.
- Observing an observable is known as subscribing.
- `Subscribe` takes an escaping closure that takes an `event` of the supplied typed (that doesnâ€™t return anything).
- Subscribe returns a `Disposable`.

```
let lotteryNumberOne = 1
let lotteryNumberTwo = 2
let lotteryNumberThree = 3

let observable = Observable.of(lotteryNumberOne, lotteryNumberTwo, lotteryNumberThree)

observable.subscribe { element in
	print(element)
}

// next(1)
// next(2)
// next(3)
// completed
```

- Above emits `next` events, the below will unwrap the optional elements and produce the value from within the element.

```
...
observable.subscribe(onNext: { lotteryNumber
	print(lotteryNumber)
})

// 1
// 2
// 3
// NO completed event
```
